Goal

The goal is to create the RESTful API as a backend application, not the front end web application.  A TODO item should contain the following information:

Title
Creation date
Last updated date
Due date
Completed (true/false)
Completion date
Your backend Flask application should implement API endpoints for the following:

List all TODO items
Retrieve a TODO item by Id
Update TODO information: title, due date, and completed
Delete a TODO item.
